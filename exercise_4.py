Exercise 4:
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out
a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly
into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    if num % i == 0:
        l.append(i)
print(l)
